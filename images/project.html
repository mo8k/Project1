<H2>Home Lab Journey</H2>
  <p>I am a tech enthusiast and I love to learn new things revolving the tech field.</p>
  <P>Over the the course of my last few months i have been working on various projects my more proud one is my home lab that I have built from scratch.</P>
  <p>It all started when began simply bypassing the accessibility of my campus network, I used a router with MAC address cloning establishing a private subnet in my dormitory this allowed me to have full control of my network traffic as well as route traffic</p>
  <p>I took a course last semester called Intro to OS and Networks, throughout this course I learn about the virtualization platform called VirtualBox.This course provided the crucial foundation and understanding of Type-2 hypervisors, the logic of virtual switching, and the nuances of hardware abstraction.  virtual cyberlab to test and learn about various networking concepts like configuring a virtual firewall and routing VLANs to different virtual machines like kali linux Metasploite and Ubuntu server.</p>
  <p>Running this entire stack on my primary desktop meant interference with daily use of my computer this what when I needed dedicated compute resources.That experience sparked my interest in building my own physical home lab so that I could have a dedicated environment for testing and learning without interfering with my daily computing needs running 24/7.</p>
  <p>I started of by purchasing two micro-PCs and Dell Optiplex Mini and an HP helpdesk 800 G1 installed Proxmox VE allowing me to configure the node as a cluster centralized management.I experimented with the 2 nodes for a bit where I was learning network architecture and segmentation with VLAN configuration and mainly experimenting with variety of services, alongside running labs like penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.</p>
  <p>That wasnt enough for me, I eventually expanded to a three-node setup establishing quorum using a Tplink managed switch to segment my traffic from router directly to nodes. I was then able to get my hands on a Dell Optiplex 980 on campus where I installed Opensense transforming it into a physical firewall and router From there I was able to move my node from my home network to a dedicated management VLAN through 802.1 VLAN tagging, ensuring that management traffic and lab traffic are logically isolated. I was able to get my hands on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ where I placed on a dedicated VLAN. Configured AdGuard as high level DNS filtering and Unbound as a recursive DNS resolver, eliminating reliance on third-party upstream providers like Google or Cloudflare for better privacy and security.</p>

  <h1>A bit about me</h1>
  <p>I am secound-year student at Illinois insitiute of Technology.</p>
  <p>I am here studing Cybersecurity & Information Technology.</p>
  <p>I am a Chicago native born and raised in the South Side of Chicago.</p>
  <p>My nationality is Malian and my home country is Mali.</p>

  <H2>My Interests</H2>
  <p>I am a tech enthusiast and I love to learn new things revolving the tech field.</p>
  <P>Over the the course of my last few months i have been working on various projects my more proud one is my home lab that I have built from scratch.</P>
  <p>It all started when began simply bypassing the accessibility of my campus network, I used a router with MAC address cloning establishing a private subnet in my dormitory this allowed me to have full control of my network traffic as well as route traffic</p>
  <p>I took a course last semester called Intro to OS and Networks, throughout this course I learn about the virtualization platform called VirtualBox.</p>
  <p>Here I was able to be a virtural cyberlab to test and learn about various networking concepts like configuring a vitural firewall and routing VLANs to differnt virtural machines like kali linux Metasploite and Ubuntu server.</p>
  <p>Running this entire stack on my primary desktop meant interference with daily use of my computer this what when I needed dedicated compute resources.</p>
  <p>That experience sparked my interest in building my own physical home lab so that I could have a dedicated environment for testing and learning without interfering with my daily computing needs running 24/7.</p>
  <p>I started of by purchasing two micro-PCs and Dell Optiplex Mini and an HP helpdesk 800 G1 installed Proxmox VE allowing me to configure the node as a cluster centralized management.</p>
  <p>I experimented with the 2 nodes for a bit where I was learning network architecture and segmentation with VLAN configuration and mainly experimenting with variety of services, alongside running labs like penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.</p>
